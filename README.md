# Privacy-Policy

This Privacy Policy governs your use of my Mobile Application United Walls, that was created by Paras Mohandas Khanchandani Chandani.

Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed by me to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly app-experience, including its contents, and the services offered there.

Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.

The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under my own control or in conjunction with others. I also inform you below about the third-party components I use to fund the service and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.


## I. Information about me as controllers of your data

The party responsible for this service for purposes of data protection law is:

Paras Mohandas Khanchandani Chandani
Email: paraskhanchandani1315@gmail.com

## II. The rights of users and data subjects

### GDPR

With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right:

- to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);

- to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);

- to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 GDPR), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;

- to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);

- to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).

In addition, I am obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.

Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to my future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.

### CCPA Privacy Rights (Do Not Sell My Personal Information)

Under the CCPA, among other rights, California consumers have the right to:

- Request that a business that collects a consumer's personal data disclose the categories and specific pieces of personal data that a business has collected about consumers.

- Request that a business delete any personal data about the consumer that a business has collected.

- Request that a business that sells a consumer's personal data, not sell the consumer's personal data.

If you make a request, I have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact me.


## III. Information about the data processing

### Server Data (NodeJS Server, MongoDB Database)

My App requires an Internet Connection to connect to my Server. It does not collect any information or data about you as the user (No-Log-Policy).

The database does only include data to store our Wallpapers' Information as well as only the Username (Telegram handle) of who saved that Wallpaper, to give the creator proper credit.

The basis for this procedure is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. My legitimate interest lies in the [...], functionality, [...] of my Service. 

### Telegram

As my App is directly bound to the United Setups Telegram Community, I use Telegram to offer all the Wallpaper files through our community ([Telegram Link: United Setups](https://t.me/unitedsetups)).
As the App displays direct action from the community, it's necessary for me to communicate directly with the Telegram Servers.
The App uses Telegram Servers to fetch the Wallpaper files. Telegram may collect certain user data through the use of their servers, such as device information, IP address, and location data.
If you join our Community through the given Telegram links, Telegram will also collect certain personal data.
You can review Telegramâ€™s Privacy Policy here - [https://telegram.org/privacy](https://telegram.org/privacy)

The basis for this procedure is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. My legitimate interest lies in the [...], functionality, and security of my Service. 


## IV. Security of your personal Data

The security of Your Personal Data is important to me, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
That's why the Data-Collection is reduced to an absolute minimum.


## V. Purposes of processing

I don't process any personal data by myself, to ensure your personal data and privacy is secured. To get informed about the data collection of Telegram, please read their privacy policy. - [Chapter: Processing your personal Data.](https://telegram.org/privacy#5-processing-your-personal-data)


## Notification of Changes

I reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. If I make material changes to this policy, I will notify you by posting a notice on the App prior to the effective date of the changes. Your continued use of the App after the effective date of any changes to this policy constitutes your acceptance of the changes.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us at my [email](mailto:paraskhanchandani1315@gmail.com).

## Effective Date

This privacy policy is effective as of 26th March 2023.
